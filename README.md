TRIPS, is a travel recommendation system that suggests the best places to visit according to personal
human interests through various machine learning algorithms, thus acting as a personalised
application.
TRIPS take the user’s location and his interests and in turn serve him/her with the best possible things
available for him /her to do along with the ratings given by previous users. There’s always the way to
reach out that particular location so that one never loses out his destination. TRIPS do so by analyzing
the data of previous users and then performing user-user collaborative recommendation using Pearson
Correlation method.
The vendor implementation takes it to another level. The local vendors, who are usually
overshadowed in the ever pacing word, have their feet on the grounds. The best rated local vendor is
given a profile on TRIPS and its best product/service is further promoted.
If the user is on a tight schedule and is running out of time, TRIPS is one of the most efficient way to
do more, with less. The tourists no longer have to manage their trips, as TRIPS does it in the best
efficient way. TRIPS not only gives you the best routes, where one can visit from the given starting
point and in the bounded time, along with the average time it takes to visit the particular place of
his/her own interest. The idea behind is the data provided by the previous users who have already
been to the certain place.
Although TRIPS has been restricted to tourism for Rajasthan only, it definitely has the capabilities to
rise higher in the upcoming years. The future aspects of TRIPS include, building a decentralized
application the provides the best suited package for a tourist to travel anywhere in the world, taking
into accounts the needs, wishes, time and budget of the user.
